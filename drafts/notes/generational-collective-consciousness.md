# Generational Collective Consciousness

Consciousness is passed down to our offspring - and to some extent, all of those whom we influence - through all of our corporeal actions. Just as an organism prioritizes survival and reproduction above all else, consciousness does the same. The same can probably be said of the ego. Actually, I can’t really think of any _useful_ system that is designed to fail… I do suppose that a useless system could be didactically useful. On second thought, although this claim isn’t necessarily obvious, it isn’t particularly noteworthy\

Organisms are comprised of less intelligent life forms. Are these lesser life forms aware of the role that they play in the system that is the more intelligent life form? We, ourselves, are quite aware of the communities that belong but are we conscious of the extent to which we contribute to them? Can we think of society as a life form as well? Is society conscious?
