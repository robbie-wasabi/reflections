# Fatherless Children of Earth

Maybe free will - or consciousness - emerged from the necessity for the rational animal to transcend its biological urges and align in a harmonious collaborative effort to create a higher being, god, or purpose that we all yearn for. Just as the fatherless child longs for a powerful paternal figure to push them toward their potential and protect them from danger, maybe our species as a holistic entity, too, aspires to find our metaphorical all-powerful father or, perhaps, create one. It seems obvious that the collective unconscious exists as the essence of human desire and understanding. And as such the more potent desires are stronger within the collective unconscious and the stronger desires of the collective unconscious are more potent in the individuals. This desire for meaning is deeply engrained in every one of us and affects everything we do. By this then, we can understand why the creation of a god is inevitable and it shouldnâ€™t be stopped.
