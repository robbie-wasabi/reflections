# Prescription for the Modern Man

### Intro

Each entity in our universe, including the universe itself, is a part of an interconnected, holistic system. And these systems are constructed of simpler subsystems and members of more complex ones, each bearing the unique responsibilities of their components and to their meta-systems. Consider how leaves provide nutrients to their tree, and the tree prompts its leaves to grow or fall, and the tree produces oxygen for the forest, and the forest acts as a nurturing sanctuary for the trees to flourish. Every system is assigned a unique mission in their interconnectivity. Should any system neglect its responsibilities, the consequences reverberate throughout, inflicting suffering upon every other system.

Yet, unlike other systems, conscious actors such as yourself, dear reader, often wrestle with renouncing their purpose as if they believe that they are entitled to do so. Perhaps the universe has assigned you an inconsequential role because it deems you unworthy of a purpose bearing any meaningful merit. If you believe this to be true, it would be a misuse of your energy to continue reading. However, for those of you who yearn for a greater sense of purpose, rest assured that one awaits you, as this longing emerges from within the depths of your soul.

Your soul craves purpose from deep within, radiating outward and effecting all aspects of your being and yet, many of you choose to fall short of your calling. How did you attain this prerogative? Does it stem from providence? Are you so arrogant to consider your will divine? Which deity granted you this divinity? Perhaps your willingness to defer the responsibilities entrusted to you by the cosmos is evidence of free will. But why would the cosmos grant you this innate ability if you choose to employ it in rejecting the unique role you have been assigned? Could it be a tool in which we can disregard our animalistic urges and transcend to a higher state of conscious being, aligned with a single intention? Could this be the purpose of the rational animal? I believe this to be true.

### Carry Your Cross

The universe has endowed you with a distinct purpose and the conscious freedom to reject that purpose. If you accept, your purpose involves not only the endurance of suffering, but also bravely championing your unique afflictions. It's through this suffering that you can lessen the suffering of others and in lessening their suffering, you will allay your own. By undergoing this journey, you help others discover their unique purposes and, in turn, you align with the cosmic intention and advance humanity's transcendence. For, the evolution from apes to conscious rational humans serves as evidence that the transcendence of mankind is intrinsically linked with the universe's ongoing evolution. And this evolution is a result of change, and change is born of time, and time forms part of the conscious experience. Thus, time necessitates the evolution of the conscious experience, and the evolution of the conscious experience calls for the passing of time. We must persevere.

To surrender or fail to reach one's potential is to neglect the profound responsibility entrusted to us by the cosmos itself. Those who reject this responsibility become encumbrances within the system, disrupting the delicate equilibrium. Consider how the rocks situated along the shoreline bear the relentless assault of the waves. Their endurance is a testament to resilience, a quality we, as human beings, must also uphold. We are tasked to fulfill our responsibilities, even when they confront us with hardship or suffering. Through these trials, we find opportunities for growth and evolution, enabling us to fully realize our potential and our ultimate roles in this reality. Every challenge we encounter and surmount is akin to the waves crashing against the rocks; it shapes us, hones us, and embeds us more firmly within the universal framework.

By fully embracing our suffering, we unveil concealed truths and embark on a transformative journey of self-discovery and soul fortification—the very essence that grants us the strength to endure. Just as Jesus was born to suffer and bear the weight of the cross upon his back, we also encounter our own distinct hardships and albatrosses. It is through accepting and embracing these trials that we cultivate virtues, including strength, resilience, and compassion, allowing us to grow and prosper.

### Use the Truth as a Rubric

Use the truth as a general guideline for your spirit on this journey. The truth is a beacon of light in the sea of chaos that can help to illuminate your path and guide your decisions. While the truth may sometimes be challenging to discern, remember that it is often found not in the external world, but within the depths of your own being. The truth is not a static entity but an evolving concept that grows and changes as we do. By looking inward, by seeking to understand yourself, your values, and your place in the universe, you can uncover the truths that will guide you on your path to self-fulfillment and cosmic alignment.

### Unearth and Uphold the Truth

Engage in an unceasing quest for truth, recognizing it as a foundational pillar in your journey towards aligning with your cosmic purpose. However, keep in mind that truth is not a prize to be claimed, but a guiding light to be pursued, understood, and embodied. The search for truth surpasses mere intellectual exploration and permeates every corner of your existence, shaping your thoughts, decisions, and actions in profound ways.

We often lean towards seeking validation and affirmation for our pre-existing notions, mistaking this comforting confirmation for genuine truth. Yet, those who truly thirst for truth understand the necessity of setting aside the ego's craving for validation. They invite a state of perpetual inquiry and maintain an openness to unexpected insights and perspectives. This journey compels us to scrutinize our biases, challenge our assumptions, and reevaluate our most ingrained beliefs, regardless of how deeply they are woven into the fabric of our identity.

Unveiling the truth demands the bravery to confront uncomfortable realities and to acknowledge them in their raw, unfiltered state. It involves accepting the inherent uncertainties of life, embracing the enigma of the unknown, and fostering a sense of tranquility amidst the inherent chaos. It also urges us to face our internal shadows, for self-deception can be a potent obstacle on the path to truth. Thus, discovering the truth and defending it becomes an act of courage and resilience.

Yet, the truth serves as more than just a personal beacon. It represents a common ground, a universal language understood by all souls earnestly seeking peace and understanding. It forms a sanctuary for those weary from the chaos of existence, a refuge where one can find solace and clarity amidst life's tumult. When we align with the truth, we tap into this shared understanding, fostering a deeper connection with ourselves, others, and the universe.

### Heed the Voice of Your Soul

Consider the mind as a vessel, ready to sail towards the shores of truth at your command while the soul is the masterful navigator. This intricate relationship between the soul and mind is not one of dominance, but of harmonious symbiosis.

The soul, imbued with wisdom and intuition, steers the vessel with purpose and vision. It aligns itself with the cosmic order and sets the course for the journey. The mind, in its role as a vessel, is the executor of this vision. It brings the soul's directives to life, using its vast capacities for reasoning, imagination, and adaptation to traverse the oceans of existence.

In this journey, the mind and soul must work in harmony. When the mind adheres to the soul's navigational guidance, it can successfully navigate through the turbulent waters of distractions, misconceptions, and societal pressures. It sails steadily, drawing upon the soul's inherent wisdom to guide its path towards truth.

Conversely, if the mind, swayed by external influences or internal doubts, strays from the soul's guidance, the voyage can become tumultuous. It may lead to uncharted territories fraught with confusion, self-doubt, and misalignment from the cosmic order.

Therefore, it's crucial to cultivate a harmonious partnership between the soul and mind. Allow the soul's wisdom to illuminate the course, and let the mind's abilities actualize this vision. This unity embarks you on a fulfilling journey, leading towards the realization of truth, self-discovery, and alignment with the cosmos and actualization of the self.

### Be a Vigilant Sentinel of Your Thoughts

In the panorama of the mind, thoughts serve as the protagonists, the guides steering the course of our character. The silent exchanges we partake with ourselves hold the potent potential for transformation; they mold our perspectives, drive our actions, and thus shape our very reality.

Reflect on this: your thoughts give rise to your actions. From these actions, habits that characterize you take root. It is through these habits that your character is molded. And, ultimately, your character carves out your destiny.

Acknowledge, then, the silent potency of your thoughts. Safeguard them as a mindful sentinel, permitting entry only to those born of virtue, wisdom, and truth. Do not suppress or dwell on intrusive or fanciful thoughts. Rather, scrutinize them, reflect upon them, comprehend their essence, and then, when they have served their purpose, gently usher them out of your mind as you would a guest who has overstayed their welcome.

The individual committed to realizing their role in the universe nurtures a mental garden abundant with growth, resilience, compassion, and most importantly, truth. Those who commit to this mindful cultivation of thoughts will discover their path steered towards fulfillment and harmonious alignment with the cosmos.

### Stare into the Abyss

Gaze fearlessly into the abyss and recognize the apparent emptiness that stares back. Yet, it's within this seemingly vacant stare that you may stumble upon a liberating revelation - there's nothing inherently terrifying in the abyss. The trepidation, the anxiety, and the existential dread that we often associate with it is not a property of the abyss itself, but a projection of our own fears and insecurities.

Fear, you'll find, is not an insurmountable beast looming in the shadows, but rather an inevitable byproduct of our human condition. Born from uncertainty and nourished by the unfamiliar, fear has a tendency to cast a veil over our perception, obscuring our clarity and distorting our reality.

But fear, my friend, does not have to be an adversary. It can, in fact, be a potent catalyst for growth. When confronted head-on, it can propel us towards a deeper understanding of ourselves and the cosmos. It can stir within us the courage to traverse unknown terrains, to question the status quo, to shatter the illusions of complacency, and to embrace the complexity of our existence.

The abyss, void of any inherent judgement or expectation, merely reflects back to us the truth of our fears and the breadth of our potential. So, stare into it. Welcome the discomfort that it may elicit. Embrace the uncertainty. Let it shake you out of complacency and compel you towards the quest for truth.

For, it's only when we dare to stare into the abyss that we begin to see with startling clarity our fears, hopes, and the boundless potential that lies within us. It's here, in this confrontation with the abyss, that we find the strength to forge ahead, to align with the cosmic order, and to take our rightful place in the grand symphony of the cosmos. Thus, the abyss serves not as an end, but a gateway—a stepping stone towards our ultimate self-realization and cosmic alignment.

### Practice the Law of Reciprocity

The concept of Karma is real and present in every action or inaction that we partake. Consider this: when you flash a warm smile at a stranger, isn't it likely that they will reciprocate with a smile of their own? Similarly, if you extend generosity by giving them some money, wouldn't that incite feelings of gratitude and possibly inspire them to pay it forward? In a darker scenario, if you resort to violence and assault someone, wouldn't it increase your chances of facing retribution, not just from the person you wronged, but also potentially from their friend or even their friend's friend?

As we journey towards alignment with the universal order, we emit an energy frequency that is infused with our resilience, determination, and the strength we garner from enduring trials and tribulations. This energy doesn't exist in isolation; it acts as a magnetic force, attracting others who resonate at similar frequencies, thereby inspiring them to rise, confront their challenges, and work towards fulfilling their unique potentials.

This journey and the associated energy we emit initiates a ripple effect, influencing those in our immediate vicinity before extending out to impact the collective consciousness. Each person's growth becomes a catalyst for the growth of others, setting in motion a cycle of mutual upliftment and evolution.

The energy we put out into the universe doesn't stop at influencing others. It echoes back to us, strengthening our resolve, reaffirming our path, and creating a feedback loop that perpetually draws us towards growth. As we continually evolve and grow, we motivate and inspire those around us to embark on their journey of self-fulfillment.

Hence, by reaching our potential and aligning ourselves with the cosmic order, we are not merely fulfilling our individual roles. We become conduits of inspiration, sparking a chain reaction that encourages others to reach their potentials.

### Don't Waste Energy

Exerting energy on matters beyond our control is a misuse of our potential energy, hindering our progress toward reaching our ultimate potentials and fulfilling our roles within the universe. The Stoics explain that while it is natural for us to experience emotions such as joy in response to joyous events and depression in response to depressive events, it is essential to recognize that the presence of these emotions does not inherently make an event good or bad and if this is true, then events are all neutral and why would any rational person waste energy trying to rationalize or balance something that is already rational and balanced?

Since the same event can elicit different emotional responses in different individuals based on their unique perspectives, beliefs, and life experiences, it is the interpretation and judgement we assign to an event that colors it as positive or negative. By acknowledging that events themselves are neutral, we free ourselves from the bondage of reactive emotions and gain a greater sense of control over our internal states. Instead of being swept away by the emotional fluctuations tied to external circumstances, we can cultivate a mindset that allows for equanimity and a rational evaluation of events that allows us to endure suffering.

### Reject Hedonism

Hedonism, with its focus on immediate gratification and the avoidance of suffering, is a plague to the modern man and the cosmos. For as suffering is mitigated, the soul begins to weaken, and a weak soul cannot endure suffering, and those who cannot endure suffering cannot fulfill their role in the cosmos, and those who cannot fulfill their role in the cosmos are an encumbrance, and those who are an encumbrance must be expelled in order to maintain equilibrium.

### Sins Spread like Wildfire - Don't be an Arsonist

Those who ignore the principles of the Law of Reciprocity, those who choose to emit negative energy and engage in harmful actions, leave an equal impact. They may attract similarly negative energy and experiences, contributing to a cycle of negativity that can hinder their growth and the growth of those around them. These individuals, rather than being forces of upliftment and evolution, may become sources of discord and stagnation.

This is not to say they are forever condemned to this path. The beauty of life and the universe lies in its capacity for change, growth, and renewal. Those who find themselves entangled in negativity can choose to shift their energy and actions. They can choose to engage with the world in a more constructive and positive manner, to realign themselves with the cosmic order and to commit to the path of growth and self-fulfillment. This transformation may not be easy, and it may not happen overnight, but it is possible and, in many cases, essential for both personal and universal harmony.

### Be a Good Shepherd

Rather than placing blame upon those who diverge from the cosmic order, invoke understanding and compassion. Every individual is navigating their unique journey, replete with its own set of challenges and diversions. The lazy, the disrespectful, the malicious, even those deemed evil, they operate from a place of ignorance regarding their actions' impact on their souls and those around them. For if they truly understood, they would witness the detriment they inflict upon their souls and would seek to transform their ways.

Approach these individuals with a sense of patience and caution, understanding that their behaviors are the outcome of their own struggles and misalignment with the cosmic order. Keep in mind that the only difference between a lost soul and a found one is the latter's relentless effort to seek. Hence, don't resort to retaliation or judgment; instead, embody the understanding and patience of a benevolent shepherd. Your interactions should serve as a beacon, illuminating the path towards harmony and universal alignment.

Guide by example, let your actions and responses depict the tranquility and fulfillment achieved by embracing one's unique purpose and journeying towards self-actualization. By maintaining this approach, you extend a helping hand to those adrift, subtly steering them back towards their destined path while staying steadfast on your own.
